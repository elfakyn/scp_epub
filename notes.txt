- refactor to pkgutil.get_data
- bs4


Elements we definitely don't want:
* class = page-rate-widget-box
* class = heritage-rating-module (this one aligns to right, nope)
* class = footer-wikiwalk-nav


For local links:
* WIKIDOT DOCS: the site-unix-name consists of only alphanumeric characters (0..9, 'a'..'z') and ('-')
* 
* todo: test for it


COMPONENTS:

[DONE] 1. download all pages
	[DONE] * downloader with cache support
	[DONE] * FILTER LIST OF PAGES: ONLY USE tagged 'scp', 'tale', or 'hub'.
	[DONE] * wget and attach html of pages -- this will cause correct rendering as seen on the site.
	[DONE] * Just manually create the html for scp-3125 and pop it in the thing.

2. PRETTIFY SINGLE PAGE
	* NOTE:
		* ALLOW FOR ERRORS: some pages are completely blank or have fucked up html.
	* empty divs: delete
		* specifically the div that aligns to right, eff that div
    [DONE] * rating box: delete
	[DONE] * navigation footer: delete
	[DONE] * images: delete
	* yui-navset: delete yui-nav, unwrap, prettify table, give specific class for CSS
	* collapsible block: link becomes title which is added as a text, content gets unwrapped, give specific class for CSS
	* footnotes: there's footnoteref and footnote-footer, make something nice and ebook friendly, give specific class for CSS
	* block quotes: give it a specific class for CSS
	* links: make local links redirect to correct page (/whatever -> whatever.xhtml), all other links deleted
	* ADD NEW STUFF (should this be in post-process?):
		* title add at beginning (as <p> block, give specific class for CSS?)


3. ARRANGE BOOK:
	* ORDER FOR TOC (check if files also need to be ordered):
		* FOREWORD ON DIGITAL EDITION
