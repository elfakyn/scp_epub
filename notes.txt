==============================================

COMPONENTS:

[DONE] 1. download all pages
	[DONE] * downloader with cache support
	[DONE] * FILTER LIST OF PAGES: ONLY USE tagged 'scp', 'tale', or 'hub'.
	[DONE] * wget and attach html of pages -- this will cause correct rendering as seen on the site.
	[DONE] * Just manually create the html for scp-3125 and pop it in the thing.

2. PRETTIFY SINGLE PAGE
* NOTE:
	[NO, UNLESS NECESSARY] * delete the div that aligns right and is at the very beginning of every page ( should we do this? what if there's a page that doesn't have that div but has another one instead with actual content)
[DONE] * WHAT PYSCP DOES (MAKE COMPATIBLE):
	[DONE] * remove widget box
	[DONE] * yui-navset
	[DONE] * collapsible-block
	[DONE] * footnoteref, footnote footer: BREAK COMPATIBILITY WITH PYSCP, MAKE NICE FOR EPUB
	[DONE] * blockquote
	[DONE] * links
	[DONE] * images
	[DONE] * title
[DONE] * Put them all together to parse a whole page
	[DONE] * Component test that correctly parses whole web html files
	[DONE] * I want some sort of test that the output of the combined parsers makes sense. Even if just a regression test.
[DONE] * Process all pages
	[DONE] * Error handling: e.g. each item in its own try-catch with logging of errors
		[DONE] * Log errors verbosely, exactly what failed and how
	[DONE] * Platform test: parse LITERALLY ALL THE SCP PAGES and test that none fail, or <N fail.

3. CREATE BOOK
* Dynamically generate pages:
	* Section Titles
	* Indices and credits generator (based on tags):
		* Internal link
		* Author
		* Created at
		* Link to website entry
[DONE] * Book definition for complete collection
* TOC generator: creates a TOC & spine (page order) from a list of pages & a book definition
	* Pages are consumed in order and appear only once
	* Discards all pages not in TOC
* Add metadata:
	* Ebook metadata
	* CSS
	* Cover image
* Generate book file
	* End-to-end platform test

==============================================
