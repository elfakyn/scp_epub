- refactor to pkgutil.get_data
- bs4


Elements we definitely don't want:
* class = page-rate-widget-box
* class = heritage-rating-module (this one aligns to right, nope)
* class = footer-wikiwalk-nav


For local links:
* WIKIDOT DOCS: the site-unix-name consists of only alphanumeric characters (0..9, 'a'..'z') and ('-')
* local links will match regex ^\/[a-z0-9\-]+$
* todo: test for it

PAGE EDGE CASES:
	* scp-3125: has weird obfuscated text content on part of it. But there's a noninteractive bit.
	* pages using ListPages
		* how to tell: has "[[module ListPages ...]]" in the "content" attribute.
		* some SCPs have this as a gimmick.
		* most hubs use this.
		* 

COMPONENTS:
[DONE] 0. download all pages
1. SELECT PAGES
	* content pages that can use html directly
	* pages with ListPages that have no content -> 
1. parse each page into nice XML
    * rating box: delete
	* navigation footer: delete
	* yui-navset: delete yui-nav, unwrap, prettify table, give specific class for CSS
	* collapsible block: link becomes title which is added as a text, content gets unwrapped, give specific class for CSS
	* footnotes: there's footnoteref and footnote-footer, make something nice and ebook friendly, give specific class for CSS
	* block quotes: give it a specific class for CSS
	* images: delete
	* links: make local links redirect to correct page (/whatever -> whatever.xhtml), all other links deleted
	* how in the fuck to deal with interactive pages?
	* ADD NEW STUFF:
		* title add at beginning as <p> block, give specific class for CSS
	* ALLOW FOR ERRORS: some pages are completely blank or have fucked up html.
2. arrange book
	* group pages (nested)
		* SCPs by series, groups of 100
		* other pages by parent
		* create DAG
	* order pages
		* have a nice structure
	* add helper pages:
		* intro
		* landing to other SCPs??
		* add credits page at the end
			* build from meta on every page? or is there a credits page pre built
	* create TOC following nested groupings
3. add book metadata, 
	* title, authors etc.
	* cover photo
	* CSS
		* fix weird right align if not already fixed

===================
Long-term: 
 * add support for images
 * top rated, other meta pages would be nice
 * option for sub-books of only some content
